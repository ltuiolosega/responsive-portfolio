# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

## Directions
Create 3 pages that change when the size of the page is altered. These 3 pages need to be linked to each other.

## Getting Started
 #contact.html steps
    1. I created the files index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
    2. Used all in one code to contain all sections
        <div class="container">
            <!-- Content here -->
        </div>
    3.
